## How to Use Binance Referral Code 47269192 in Luxembourg

Follow these steps to register a new Binance account with the referral code applied:

1. Go to [binance.com/register?ref=47269192](https://accounts.binance.com/register?ref=47269192). The referral code will be pre-filled automatically.
2. Enter your email address (or phone number) and create a password.
3. Verify that the Referral ID field shows **47269192**. If the field is empty, look for a collapsed section labeled "Have a referral code?" or "Referral ID (Optional)" and enter the code manually.
4. Complete the registration and confirm your email.
5. Go through KYC (identity verification) — this requires a valid government-issued ID and a selfie. Luxembourg residents typically receive approval within minutes, though it can take up to 24 hours.
6. Make your first EUR deposit via SEPA transfer and start trading with reduced fees.

> **Important:** The referral code can only be entered at the time of registration. Binance does not allow adding or changing referral codes after an account is created. Customer support cannot apply a code retroactively. If you registered without a code, the only option is creating a new account with a different email address.

## What Discount Does the Referral Code Give?

The referral code **47269192** permanently reduces Binance trading fees. Here is how fees compare with and without the code:

| Fee Type | Standard Fee | With Referral Code 47269192 | With Code + BNB Payment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spot Maker | 0.1000% | 0.0800% | ~0.0600% |
| Spot Taker | 0.1000% | 0.0800% | ~0.0600% |
| Futures Maker | 0.0200% | 0.0180% | ~0.0135% |
| Futures Taker | 0.0500% | 0.0450% | ~0.0338% |

The 20% spot discount is permanent. It applies to every trade for the lifetime of the account. Holding BNB (Binance's native token) and enabling BNB fee payment adds an additional 25% reduction on top of the referral discount. Combined, this brings total savings to approximately 40–45% compared to the base fee structure.

### Savings Example

A trader executing $50,000 in monthly spot volume at the standard 0.10% taker fee pays $50/month in fees. With the referral code, the same volume costs $40/month. With BNB payment enabled, fees drop to approximately $30/month. Over one year, that amounts to $120–$240 in savings from the referral code alone.

## $100 USDT Welcome Bonus — How It Works

New accounts registered with referral code **47269192** are eligible for up to $100 USDT in welcome rewards. The bonus is split across three tasks:

| Task | Reward | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Complete KYC verification | $20 USDT voucher | Upload government ID + selfie |
| Make first deposit | $30 USDT voucher | Minimum ~$50 deposit |
| Execute first spot trade | $50 USDT voucher | Trade with $10+ value |

### Conditions to Be Aware Of

The $100 USDT is distributed as **trading fee vouchers, not withdrawable cash**. A $50 voucher, for example, covers $50 worth of future trading fees. Once cumulative fees reach $50, the voucher is fully consumed. Welcome tasks must be completed within **30 days** of account creation, and voucher redemption windows typically range from 7 to 30 days. Unclaimed or expired vouchers are forfeited.

This is a detail that many guides fail to mention. The bonus has real value — it directly offsets trading costs — but it cannot be withdrawn as cash.

## Binance in Luxembourg — Availability and Regulation

Binance is fully accessible in Luxembourg. Residents can use all core platform features, including spot trading, futures, staking, savings products, Launchpool, and peer-to-peer (P2P) trading.

### Regulatory Status

Luxembourg falls under the EU's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulatory framework. The CSSF (Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier) is Luxembourg's designated authority for overseeing crypto-asset service providers. In January 2025, Luxembourg formally adopted MiCA into national law, replacing the previous VASP registration regime.

Luxembourg has adopted the full 18-month transitional period under MiCA, allowing existing crypto service providers to continue operating until **July 1, 2026**, while they transition to full CASP (Crypto-Asset Service Provider) authorization.

As of early 2026, Binance has applied for a pan-EU MiCA license through Greece's Hellenic Capital Market Commission (HCMC). The application is being processed on an expedited basis. Once approved, this license would allow Binance to operate across all 27 EU member states under MiCA's passporting framework. In the meantime, Binance continues to serve European users under existing national authorizations.

### EUR Deposits and Withdrawals for Luxembourg

Luxembourg is on the list of countries supported for EUR bank transfers via SEPA on Binance. Available methods:

| Method | Processing Time | Fee |
|---|---|---|
| SEPA Bank Transfer | 1–3 business days | From €0.30 per transaction |
| SEPA Instant | Seconds to minutes | €1 per transaction |
| Credit/Debit Card (Visa/Mastercard) | Instant | 1.8%–2% |

SEPA transfers must originate from a bank account matching the name on your Binance account. SWIFT transfers are not supported for EUR deposits — funds sent via SWIFT will be rejected and returned.

### Stablecoin Availability in the EEA

As of March 2025, Binance delisted several non-MiCA-compliant stablecoins for EEA users, including USDT (Tether), TrueUSD, and DAI. USDC (issued by Circle, which holds MiCA authorization) remains fully available and is currently the primary USD-pegged stablecoin for EU-based Binance users.

### Languages

Binance supports French, German, and English — all three administrative languages of Luxembourg.

## How Binance Fees Compare to Other Exchanges

| Exchange | Spot Taker Fee (Standard) | With Best Referral Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Binance** | 0.1000% | **0.0800%** (code 47269192) |
| OKX | 0.1000% | 0.0800% |
| Bybit | 0.1000% | 0.0800% |
| Kraken | 0.2500% | 0.2000% |
| Coinbase | 0.4000–0.6000% | N/A |

Binance maintains the lowest base fee tier among major exchanges. When the referral discount is combined with BNB fee payment, effective rates can drop to approximately 0.055% — significantly below most competitors.

## Binance Referral Code vs Binance Promo Code

These terms are sometimes used interchangeably, but they function differently:

| | Referral Code | Promo Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Code** | **47269192** | Varies (time-limited) |
| **When to use** | During registration | On specific promo pages |
| **Benefit** | 20% lifetime fee discount + welcome bonus | Campaign-specific rewards |
| **Duration** | Permanent | Temporary |
| **Stackable** | Yes, with BNB discount | Depends on campaign |

The referral code **47269192** provides the highest available standard discount. Promotional codes may offer additional bonuses for specific campaigns (such as trading competitions, seasonal events, or new product launches), but they do not replace the referral fee discount.

### Why was USDT delisted on Binance for EU users?

The process requires a valid government-issued ID (passport, national ID card, or driver's license) and a selfie photo. In some cases, additional Source of Wealth documentation may be requested, which can extend the review to up to 10 business days.

### Is Binance safe to use in Luxembourg?

Binance employs industry-standard security measures including cold storage for the majority of user funds, the SAFU (Secure Asset Fund for Users) emergency insurance fund, mandatory 2FA, withdrawal address whitelisting, and regular Proof of Reserves audits. Luxembourg users are additionally protected under EU consumer protection regulations as MiCA enforcement progresses.

Yes. Futures trading (USDT-margined and coin-margined) is available to Luxembourg residents. The referral code **47269192** provides a 10% discount on futures trading fees. Note that futures trading involves higher risk due to leverage and is not suitable for all users.

## Why Luxembourg Users Choose Binance

Binance is the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by daily trading volume, processing over $10 billion in trades per day across hundreds of trading pairs. For Luxembourg-based traders, several factors make it a practical choice:

**Low fees with the referral discount.** Binance already offers among the lowest base fees in the industry. With referral code **47269192** applied, spot taker fees drop to 0.08% — roughly 5–8x cheaper than Coinbase and 2–3x cheaper than Kraken for equivalent volume levels.

**EUR integration.** Full support for SEPA and SEPA Instant means Luxembourg users can deposit and withdraw euros directly from their local bank accounts. No currency conversion is needed, and SEPA deposits arrive within 1–3 business days (or seconds with SEPA Instant).

**Regulatory trajectory.** With the MiCA license application submitted through Greece in January 2026, Binance is actively working toward full EU-wide authorization before the July 2026 deadline. Luxembourg's CSSF will continue to play a supervisory role under MiCA's passporting framework, ensuring local consumer protection standards apply.

**Asset selection.** Binance lists over 400 cryptocurrencies and 1,500+ trading pairs — significantly more than most European competitors. This includes major assets (BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL), DeFi tokens, and newly launched projects through Launchpool.

**Security infrastructure.** Binance operates the Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU), an emergency insurance fund established in 2018. The platform uses cold storage for the majority of user assets, employs two-factor authentication (2FA), address whitelisting, and anti-phishing codes. Proof of Reserves (PoR) audits are published regularly to demonstrate 1:1 backing of user assets.

## Binance VIP Fee Tiers

The referral code discount applies on top of Binance's VIP tier structure. As trading volume increases over a 30-day rolling window, fees decrease further:

| VIP Level | 30-Day Volume (BUSD) | Spot Maker / Taker | With Referral Code |
|---|---|---|---|
| Regular | < $1M | 0.1000% / 0.1000% | 0.0800% / 0.0800% |
| VIP 1 | ≥ $1M | 0.0900% / 0.1000% | 0.0720% / 0.0800% |
| VIP 2 | ≥ $5M | 0.0800% / 0.1000% | 0.0640% / 0.0800% |
| VIP 3 | ≥ $20M | 0.0420% / 0.0600% | 0.0336% / 0.0480% |
| VIP 4 | ≥ $100M | 0.0200% / 0.0400% | 0.0160% / 0.0320% |

Higher VIP tiers also unlock increased withdrawal limits, priority customer support, and access to exclusive OTC (over-the-counter) trading desks. The 20% referral discount compounds with every VIP tier, meaning the savings grow as your volume increases.
